This project aims to develop and verify a correlation between the water parameters such as chlorophyll concentration, temperature, salinity, pH, and specific concentration with Dissolved Oxygen(DO).
Therefore, we require both in-situ and remote observation to make quantitative predictions. 

Here we have utilized the USGS real-time water parameters for in-situ observations and AQUA-MODIS from NASA ocean color(NASA OBPG) as the remote dataset, discussed in section II.I and II.II respectively.

For analyzing and predicting the dissolved oxygen concentration, a multiple regression model is developed using the data from 2018-01-01 to 2021-12-31, discussed in section II.III
